This repository includes solutions to Advent of Code puzzles as well as a client for downloading puzzle inputs.

## Building
The solutions are designed to be independently imported by external go programs, but this repository also includes the source code (in the `cmd` directory) for a program that provides a convenient CLI for running them. 


## Running
Before using the client to download inputs and/or submit answers, you must set the value of an environment variable named `AOC_SESSION` to the value of the `session` cookie from the Advent of Code website.
```
export AOC_SESSION={your_session_cookie_value}
./cmd -get
./cmd -submit
```
Puzzle inputs are stored at the path `aoc/inputs/$YEAR/$DAY.txt`. Example inputs for a given day should be stored at `aoc/$YEAR/d$DAY/example.txt`.

Templates for solution packages can be generated by building and running the program in the `template` directory.
